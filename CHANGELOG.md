# Changelog

All notable changes to the Temporal Graph Transformer project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.1] - 2024-09-23

### Critical Discovery
- **ðŸš¨ MAJOR GAP IDENTIFIED**: Real data collection was never completed despite being marked as done
- **Missing Real Data**: Zero actual transaction data files found in codebase (0 .csv, .json, .parquet files)
- **Missing Hunter Ground Truth**: No verified airdrop hunter addresses collected
- **Missing API Integration**: Only interface code exists, no actual data collection scripts

### Plan Revision
- **Added Phase 4.5**: Real Data Collection (Weeks 14.5-16) - CRITICAL PRIORITY
- **Postponed Phase 5**: Experimental validation now depends on Phase 4.5 completion
- **Updated Milestones**: Revised timeline to reflect actual project status
- **Project Status**: Revised from 90% to 75% complete due to missing data foundation

### Requirements for Phase 4.5
- Real transaction datasets: 500K+ transactions across all 5 blockchain ecosystems
- Hunter ground truth: 10K+ verified airdrop hunter addresses with behavior labels
- Working API integrations: The Graph Protocol, Jupiter API, Alchemy/QuickNode, Helius
- Data quality validation: >95% completeness with validated temporal coverage
- Storage infrastructure: Efficient data loading (<1 minute) for ML training
